## Introduction
Legged motion is one of the most demanding movements in mobile robots. Interest in developing an artificial muscle for smooth legged motion.

## Research Question
How can we design an elemental artificial muscle by controlling stiffness and manufacturing material to reproduce the same biomechanical properties as that of muscles involved in human running gait cycle?
